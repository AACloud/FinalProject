Here is my final project
Candy Crush: Sour Patch Edition
This is my final project for my web development course and what made me think about this was I had an interview recently and the question was called candy crush (Not Design Candy Crush), the question had similar properties and I thought why not use candy crush for my final project and while I was coding it I was eating sour patch kids :D
I learned a lot making this project such as connecting images to the app and making the images move as candies do in candy crush, I learned many react concepts!
